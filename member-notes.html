<h1>Virtual handbells: Using social media and the web</h1>

<p><strong>Interested in creating a website for your community or church group &#8212; or have a website already and want to engage fans in social media?</strong> These days, you don't need to be a programmer to create a website, and even 15 minutes a week on social media can help you get the word out about your events. Let's take a look.</p>

<h2>What's your story?</h2>

<p>Who are you, why do you do what you do, and what will people experience when they come to see you?</p>

<p>Different groups present different personas. If you look at the <a href="http://kiriku-handbell.weebly.com/english.html">Kiriku ensemble from Japan</a>, their website says "classy." Whereas <a href="http://embellishhandbells.com/">Embellish from Western Michigan</a> comes across as "playful." <a href="http://sonos.org/">Sonos from California</a> looks innovative, while a peek at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Raleigh-Ringers/8101004253?ref=sgm">The Raleigh Ringers' Facebook page</a> reveals creativity.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it is your handbell group's mission or purpose: Is it to advance the art of handbell ringing? Is it to bring handbell performances to audiences who are unfamiliar with the instrument? Is it to act as an expression of faithful ministry?</p>

<p>As the examples above show, there's no one right answer, but thinking about how to present your website &#8212; and especially how to communicate on social media &#8212; will be much easier if you know what kind of impression your group wants to have.</p>

<h2>Creating a website</h2>

<p>The first question is to decide whether you want to have your own website. Church-only choirs will probably work just fine having a single page on a church's website. If you're a church choir who also plays in the community, it might make sense to have your own website so you can more easily list events and solicit bookings. And if you're a community ensemble, you'll definitely want to have your own website, even if it's a simple one.</p>

<h3>Website options</h3>

<p><strong>Using a Facebook page as your website.</strong> If your group is new or small, or if you don't want the overhead of maintaining a separate website, turning to Facebook might be a viable option, especially if some of your members are already using it. Creating a Facebook page is different from a personal profile &#8212; multiple people can administer it, and by default it's viewable by people who aren't logged into Facebook. If you go the Facebook route, be sure to get a "username" for it &#8212; a much shorter address than the default numerical one &#8212; and take advantage of Facebook's built-in systems like events, photo galleries and videos, rather than sending people off somewhere else. Finally, it's worth keeping in mind that not everyone uses Facebook, and while anyone will be able to view your Facebook page, only those logged in will be able to comment or contact you.</p>

<p><strong>Using WordPress.com with a custom domain as your website.</strong> WordPress is a free blogging platform that is used in two different ways: It can be downloaded and installed on your own server, or it can be used online for free with ads. I'm suggesting the second option. It's very easy to use and has <a href="https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sort/free/">lots of compelling designs</a> that look great on both computers and mobile devices. You can get your own domain (like yourbellgroup.org) to use with it <a href="https://store.wordpress.com/premium-upgrades/custom-domains/">for just $18 per year</a>. It does have ads, which you can <a href="https://store.wordpress.com/plans/">remove for $100 per year</a> (along with getting other benefits). So you can do it for free &#8212; with some limitations &#8212; or for a little outlay of money. But all the complicated stuff about hosting a website is handled for you.</p>

<p><strong>Using Pushtape to design and host your own website.</strong> This is advanced-level stuff: This means getting your own web hosting and setting up your own web platform. But <a href="http://pushtape.com/">Pushtape</a> is a great free option, built on the open-source Drupal platform, that has a bunch of built-in features specifically for musical groups. While setting it up requires a little technical skill, the nice thing is that once it's going, non-technical folks can easily log in and update the site, just like you would with WordPress.com above. We use it on the <a href="http://bellsofthecascades.org/">Bells of the Cascades</a> website, along with a custom-built design, and it's worked really well.</p>

<p><strong>Web forms:</strong> Regardless of what choice you make, at some point you'll probably want to collect some information. Whether it's registering people for events, inviting people to be on your email list, accepting booking requests, or enabling online audition inquiries, you'll need a place for people to do that. There are options that you can integrate into WordPress or Pushtape, and several if you need an "e-commerce" component (like selling tickets), but the easiest and free-est option is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzgaUOW6GIs">Google Forms</a>.

<h2>Social media</h2>

<p><strong>There are so many social media options out there &#8212; where to start?!</strong></p>

<p>First, don't engage in social media unless you have the capacity to keep it updated. It's actually worse to have a profile that hasn't been updated in months and months than to not have one at all. Plus, social media isn't a billboard &#8212; it's <em>social!</em> &#8212; so plan to have some conversations and answer some questions with your fans, not just post event announcements like you're handing out press releases.</p>

<p>You might be familiar with the saying that a church isn't the building, it's the people. When you tell your story, you want to focus on the people. Instead of talking about "we" as a handbell group, talk about the musicians, talk about the history behind the music you're performing, talk about the community in which you're presenting your work, talk about the ministry within the musical text. Talk about the people, not the buildings -- or, in this case, the entity known as your handbell group.</p>

<p>In terms of networks, for <em>most</em> groups, the best spots are going to be <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong>. If you have people in your group who are adept at taking and sharing media (or if you're committed to appealing to a youth and young-adult audience), then you might do well on secondary networks like <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Tumblr</strong>, <strong>Vine</strong> and others. But the choice of networks isn't as important as being active on them.</p>

<h3>What do I post?</h3>

<p>Social media is about conversations and relationships. You should, of course, let people know about your concerts. But think about how to engage people beyond those singular announcements, and communicate <em>in your group's voice</em> about what you're all about.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> Putting in long hours working on a particularly hard piece? Grab a 5-second clip of it and share it on social media! You don't have to give away the details of the piece if you don't want to, but people getting to see a bit of what you've got planned &#8212; whether you're already pulling it off, or still struggling to get it right &#8212; will make them want to show up and see the real thing! And if you've got a mobile connection at your events, get some shots behind the stage, during set-up, of the dress rehearsal, carrying bells or tables around &#8212; show all the work that goes into your performance!</p>

<p><strong>Lean toward photos and videos:</strong> These get shared much more than text posts (if you have a long text post, be sure to have a photo or video as part of it) and perhaps more importantly, they're actually faster to do once you get the hang of it! A picture might be worth a thousand words, but it also takes a thousanth of the time than to write all those words &#8212; and people will like it more anyway. Win!</p>

<p><strong>Ask questions:</strong> This tends to work well when you've already got a sizeable group of people talking to you &#8212; leaving comments, sharing your posts, and occasionally messaging you. Once you've got a little engagement, start asking them what they think. The possibilities are endless: Their favorite piece on handbells, their favorite piece they'd <em>like</em> to see on handbells, their favorite holiday tune or hymn, or even something unrelated to music. Asking questions, and having people answer them, is one more opportunity for your group's name to show up in their feeds and dashboards and keep you in their minds when concert season rolls around. Just make sure that when they do answer, you give them a response &#8212; "cool," "&#128077;," or "love that one too!" are fine, but they need to know you're listening!</p>

<p><strong>Become a handbell expert:</strong> You almost certainly know more about handbells than most people you know. You know <em>way too much about handbells</em>, and you've been looking for a place to share it. Now's your chance! Share the history of bells, the history of your group, videos of handbells being used in television or popular music. Or follow handbell groups in other parts of the country and re-post interesting videos or photos from them! Trust me, people who come to your concerts are not going to suddenly stop coming because you shared an impressive video from a group 500 miles away. If they love handbells, they'll appreciate that video <em>and</em> want to see your own group the next time you perform. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/handbellbrothers">Handbell Brothers' Facebook page</a> is a great example of this kind of "content curation."</p>

<p><strong>Create something special:</strong> You know what you like to share, and what your friends like to share (two bucks says at least one of those things is cute cats). Consider making something especially for social media &#8212; a few members dressed in a funny costume, a 20-second rendition of a popular song on bells, a clip of your the ringers cracking faces to try to make the director laugh, or <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/AZIAAOSwBLlVCbx7/s-l300.jpg">gift ideas for future ringers</a>.
